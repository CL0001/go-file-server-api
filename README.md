# File Handler Microservice
This project was part of my internship during the years 2024/25. **This is a refactor of the Python version of this handler, which is available [here](https://github.com/CL0001/python-file-server-api.git).**


## Requirements
To run this project, the only requirement is **Docker**, thanks to the containerization and orchestration.


## How to Run
Clone this repository to your desired location:
```
git clone https://github.com/CL0001/opencv-auto-build.git
```
Alternatively, you can download it as a .zip file.

Once that's done, run the following command to start the services:
```
docker-compose up
```

You can then access the service at:
```
http://localhost:8000
```
